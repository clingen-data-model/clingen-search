* On data import, there is no typechecking when a property should have a resource as its object, but instead recieves a literal

This was noticed as a part of the malfunctioning gene / load triples script. The resource expected as a target a gene IRI, and instead imported a string literal with the Gene IRI. This error was corrected, but leaves an issue where object properties may instead return a literal.

** Suggested resolution:

Properties in OWL have either a Data Property or a Object Property type. Ensure on import that these types are used to validate the object of their referent.

Alternatively, use these properties to determine the type of the referrent imported. Throw an error when type does not align as expected.

* There may be classes and properties that aren't namespaced appropriately in local-names

When the base is imported, a check should be made for any un-namespaced keywords in local-names, these should be at least pointed out
